  <p>Refunds an application fee that has previously been collected but not yet refunded.
  Funds will be refunded to the Stripe account from which the fee was originally collected.</p>
  
  <p>You can optionally refund only part of an application fee.
  You can do so multiple times, until the entire fee has been refunded.</p>
  
  <p>Once entirely refunded, an application fee canâ€™t be refunded again.
  This method will raise an error when called on an already-refunded application fee,
  or when trying to refund more money than is left on an application fee.</p>
