docs {
  <p>When you create a new reversal, you must specify a transfer to create it on.</p>
  
  <p>When reversing transfers, you can optionally reverse part of the transfer. You can do so as many times as you wish until the entire transfer has been reversed.</p>
  
  <p>Once entirely reversed, a transfer canâ€™t be reversed again. This method will return an error when called on an already-reversed transfer, or when trying to reverse more money than is left on a transfer.</p>
