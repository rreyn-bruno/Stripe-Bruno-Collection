  <p>When you create a new refund, you must specify a Charge or a PaymentIntent object on which to create it.</p>
  
  <p>Creating a new refund will refund a charge that has previously been created but not yet refunded.
  Funds will be refunded to the credit or debit card that was originally charged.</p>
  
  <p>You can optionally refund only part of a charge.
  You can do so multiple times, until the entire charge has been refunded.</p>
  
  <p>Once entirely refunded, a charge canâ€™t be refunded again.
  This method will raise an error when called on an already-refunded charge,
  or when trying to refund more money than is left on a charge.</p>
