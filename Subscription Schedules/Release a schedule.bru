  <p>Releases the subscription schedule immediately, which will stop scheduling of its phases, but leave any existing subscription in place. A schedule can only be released if its status is <code>not_started</code> or <code>active</code>. If the subscription schedule is currently associated with a subscription, releasing it will remove its <code>subscription</code> property and set the subscriptionâ€™s ID to the <code>released_subscription</code> property.</p>
