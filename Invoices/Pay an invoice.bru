docs {
  <p>Stripe automatically creates and then attempts to collect payment on invoices for customers on subscriptions according to your <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic">subscriptions settings</a>. However, if youâ€™d like to attempt payment on an invoice out of the normal collection schedule or for some other reason, you can do so.</p>
