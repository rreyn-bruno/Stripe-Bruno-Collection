  <p>Mark a finalized invoice as void. This cannot be undone. Voiding an invoice is similar to <a href="#delete_invoice">deletion</a>, however it only applies to finalized invoices and maintains a papertrail where the invoice can still be found.</p>
  
  <p>Consult with local regulations to determine whether and how an invoice might be amended, canceled, or voided in the jurisdiction youâ€™re doing business in. You might need to <a href="#create_invoice">issue another invoice</a> or <a href="#create_credit_note">credit note</a> instead. Stripe recommends that you consult with your legal counsel for advice specific to your business.</p>
