  <p>You can delete coupons via the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons">coupon management</a> page of the Stripe dashboard. However, deleting a coupon does not affect any customers who have already applied the coupon; it means that new customers canâ€™t redeem the coupon. You can also delete coupons via the API.</p>
